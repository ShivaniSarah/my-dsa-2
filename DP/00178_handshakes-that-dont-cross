1259. Handshakes That Don’t Cross
Description
You are given an even number of people numPeople that stand around a circle and each person shakes hands with someone else so that there are numPeople / 2 handshakes total.

Return the number of ways these handshakes could occur such that none of the handshakes cross.

Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:



Input: numPeople = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to do it, the first way is [(1,2),(3,4)] and the second one is [(2,3),(4,1)].
Example 2:



Input: numPeople = 6
Output: 5
 

Constraints:

2 <= numPeople <= 1000
numPeople is even.



# java



class Solution {
  public int numberOfWays(int numPeople) {
    final long MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    // dp[i] := the number of ways i handshakes could occure s.t. none of the
    // handshakes cross
    long[] dp = new long[numPeople / 2 + 1];
    dp[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 1; i <= numPeople / 2; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < i; ++j) {
        dp[i] += dp[j] * dp[i - 1 - j];
        dp[i] %= MOD;
      }

    return (int) dp[numPeople / 2];
  }
}

    public int numberOfWays(int numPeople) {
        f = new int[numPeople + 1];
        return dfs(numPeople);
