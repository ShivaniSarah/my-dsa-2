This repo is for Hard problems.

Time complexity & Space Complexity Analysis

In dfs or bfs TC = O(n) => mot problems cover graph and binary tree or bonary search tree

SC => recursion stack => O(height) , in balanced tree it SC = O(log n) and skewed tree it is SC = O(n) in case of dfs

SC => recursion stack => O(max width of last level) , in case of bfs
