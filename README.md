Time complexity (TC) & Space Complexity(SC) Analysis

In dfs or bfs TC = O(n) or O(V+E) => mot problems cover graph and binary tree or bonary search tree

SC => recursion stack => O(height) , in balanced tree it SC = O(log n) and skewed tree it is SC = O(n) in case of dfs

SC => recursion stack => O(max width of last level) => 2^(level-1) , in case of bfs

In Union Find => TC= O( V²*  α(V) ) ≈ O(V²) where α(V) is inverse ackermann function which grows slowly and is very small

In Union Find => SC => O(V)

In recursion , is 2^(n-1) where n is the no of levels.
